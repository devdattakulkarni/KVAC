Running Instructions:

- Start MongoDB Database Server process
  - Go to directory where you have downloaded MongoDB
  - Execute ./bin/mongod from command line
    - You may not be able to execute above command if the prior run of the process 
      was not cleanly shut-down. In such a scenario, you can delete the /data/db/mongod.lock file
      and then run mongod.
